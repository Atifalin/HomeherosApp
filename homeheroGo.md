I wanna have another app within this app - on the login screen lets create a attractive button for HomeherosGo - this app will use the same supabase and backend but it will be its own seperate app but for this prototype we will keep it as one

This is an onboarding app for Homeheros or contractors (Service providers contractors or individuals that will be serving our clients from the main app) accounts for heros will have seprate privilages that allow them to access different pages while regular users wont - 
Anyone can sign up for this but the profile will stay pending activation by ADMINs after background checks 

Here is the app flow after the sign up page 
Next step should be :
Capturing their personal details 
Name,phone address etc then put in a question are you applying as a contractor or a Homehero. - depending on this form will fork into homehero forms or contractor forms
1.Home hero : that will ask questions such as Proof of eligibility and Proof of Identification. Certifications.
* What kind of service are you interested in ?
( Home hero’s application will be then submitted to the system and int should respond as “ thanks for applying someone from our team will reach out to you shortly.
* Questions to be asked : Are you eligible to work in Canada, 
* Upload your documents: Company Registration, Business License, Previous year tax filing if applicable, Work BC Certificate, Business Insurance($2 Million)


2.Contractor Onboarding:
* Banking information.
* Date of start
* Presentation on Overview of our company.
* Privacy act ( Terms and Conditions).
THEN THE APPLICATION FOR THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE SUBMITTED WITH THE SAME RESPONSE AS THE ONE FOR HOMEHERO.
